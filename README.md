# Hybrid Crypto Example

## Using RSA and AES with Node.js and React

This is a simple example of how to use RSA and AES for hybrid encryption.

## Install dependencies

Navigate into each directory (`api` and `web`) and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the example

In the `api` directory:

1. Run `npm run build` in the `api` directory to build the project.
2. Run `node dist/genkey` in the `api` directory to generate the keys.
3. run `node dist/server` in the `api` directory to start the server.

In the `web` directory

1. Run `npm run dev` in the `web` directory to start the web app.
2. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.
